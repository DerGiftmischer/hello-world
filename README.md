# hello-world
My githup tutorial project

Hi I'm Stefan and I started coding in Python 3 a few months ago.
I almost have a bachelors degree in chemistry.
I code in my freetime and never learned coding in school/college.
A friend told me about GitHub and I just want to give it a shot,
although I'm a beginner.
